        the best prime rib dish below!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 pounds prime rib roast</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, about 
            4 hours.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until 
            well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. 
            Season roast generously with kosher salt.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Roast the 4-pound prime rib (see footnote if using a larger and 
            smaller roast) in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn the oven 
            off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let 
            the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours. Remove roast from the oven, 
            slice, and serve.</li>
      </ol>
